                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>These lilies are special, the petals are not interested in other factors, they only react and bloom when they hear the song, and when the music disappears, they slowly close again.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>Each Lily is composed of a stem, several leaves, multiple layers of petals, and stamens.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Responds to nearby sounds by blooming.</li>
                    <li>Each petal gradually changes from pink to white from the inside out.</li>
                    <li>Blooms in the presence of calm, gentle interactions</li>

                The Blooming Lilyâ€™s most extraordinary trait is its response to sound. Unlike ordinary plants that react to light or environmental conditions, the Blooming Lily only blooms when it perceives a specific range of musical notes or gentle sounds in its vicinity. The plant exhibits a mesmerizing display of petals opening and closing in reaction to these auditory stimuli. The petals, which transition gradually from a deep pink at their base to a pristine white at the edges, seem almost to "breathe" along with the rhythm of music or voices nearby.

                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> Users can move their mouse over the canva to see the flowers react by gradually opening their petals in response to proximity. This reflects the idea of a flower responding to warmth or gentle environmental changes. Besides, when your mouse is near the lily,
